# RpUtils
RP Utils intends to provide a suite (eventually) of features to support roleplay, by connecting to RpUtils servers. Currently, it only adds an RP Sonar feature.

## RpSonar
RP Sonar, when enabled and the user is currently /roleplaying, will anonymously submit the players position to RpUtils servers. This anonymous position data is collected and organized into a cache along with other users. Users can open their map (regardless of /roleplaying or not) to search for other roleplayers nearby, or in other zones.
